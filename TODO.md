# TODO

- [ ] can just dump a bundle of URLs rather than only RSS feed since i want to
      be able to curate a little more before summarizing _everything_

- [ ] fix bug where \*Active isn't actually being updated
- [ ] split app into multiple pages, and build them separately
- [ ] order feed items by pubDate
  - figure out how to parse pubDates into actualy Date objects, and then can
    comapre temporaly
- [ ] IDEA: use server components? seems like an ideal use case here actually
